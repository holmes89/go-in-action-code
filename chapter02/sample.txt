This is a sample text file for testing the word count program.
It has multiple lines and various words to count.
Let's see how well our program works!

The program should handle:
- Multiple spaces  between   words
- Empty lines

- Different punctuation marks!
- Numbers like 123 and 456

Total words in this file should be counted correctly.
